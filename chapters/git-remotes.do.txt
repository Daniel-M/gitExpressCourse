========= GIT REMOTES =========
======= List Remotes =======

To list the remotes associated with the repository

!bc
$ git remote -v
!ec


======= Add a remote =======

You can have many "remotes" that store branches of the same repo (no matter if the name is the same)
To add a remote:

!bc
$ git remote add remote_name remote_url(with .git)
!ec

For example:

!bc
$ git remote add dev user@server.domain.do:~/MyRepo.git
!ec

Adds a remote called `dev` on the server `server.domain.do` in the repository `MyRepo`.

when you call `remote -v` you would get the list of actual remotes
